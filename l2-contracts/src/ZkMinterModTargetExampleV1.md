# ZkMinterModTargetExampleV1

## Overview
`ZkMinterModTargetExampleV1.sol` is an example implementation of a target contract designed to work with `ZkMinterModTriggerV1`. It demonstrates how to create a contract that can receive tokens and execute custom logic in a single transaction.

## Key Features
- Accepts ERC20 token transfers
- Implements a simple execution pattern for token transfers with custom logic
- Emits events for tracking transfers

## Functions

### `constructor(address _tokenAddress)`
Initializes the contract with the address of the ERC20 token it will work with.

### `executeTransferAndLogic(uint256 amount) external`
Transfers tokens from the caller to this contract and executes custom logic.
- Transfers `amount` of tokens from `msg.sender` to this contract
- Calls internal `performLogic` function
- Emits a `TransferProcessed` event

### `performLogic(uint256 amount) internal`
Internal function containing the custom logic to be executed after token transfer.
- Currently emits a `TransferProcessed` event
- Can be overridden or extended for specific use cases

## Events
- `TransferProcessed(address indexed sender, uint256 amount)`
  - Emitted when tokens are successfully transferred and logic is executed

## Usage Example
```solidity
// Deploy the target contract with the token address
ZkMinterModTargetExampleV1 target = new ZkMinterModTargetExampleV1(tokenAddress);

// Execute transfer and logic
target.executeTransferAndLogic(amount);
```

## Security Considerations
- The contract implements a basic pattern that should be extended with appropriate access controls for production use
- The `performLogic` function is a placeholder and should be implemented with the specific business logic required
